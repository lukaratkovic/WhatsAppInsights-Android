# WhatsApp Insights
WhatsApp Insights is an Android app developed in Kotlin that allows you to analyze and generate valuable insights from your WhatsApp chat history.
By importing a WhatsApp chat export, the app provides statistics in three categories: Summary, Trends, and Highlights.
With this information, you can gain a deeper understanding of your messaging patterns and uncover interesting trends within your conversations.

## Requirements
- Android device running Android 8.1 (Oreo) or above

## Getting started
To use the WhatsApp Insights app you need to export your WhatsApp chat as a .txt file.
You can do this within WhatsApp by opening a chat, tapping on the three-dot menu, selecting "More", and choosing "Export chat".
Make sure to export the chat without media, or else you won't be able to import it into the Insights app.
Once you have exported the chat, you can save it to your device or cloud in order to access it from the app.

When ready, open the WhatsApp Insights app, click the "Load file" button, and select your chat export. With the file loaded, you can begin exploring your insights!

## Summary
The Summary tab of the WhatsApp Insights app provides essential information about the conversation at a glance. It includes the following details:
- Total messages: This indicates the overall number of messages exchanged among all participants
- First and last message: Take a trip down memory lane and recall the starting point of your most important conversations, or remember those that ended with this feature
- Yearly, monthly, and daily averages: Gain insights into the activity levels of your chats through average message counts
- Messages by sender: This feature allows you to observe the messaging patterns of individual participants, giving you an insight into their level of engagement in the conversation

Please note that WhatsApp exports truncate conversations with more than 99,999 messages, which can result in incomplete insights for larger conversations

## Trends
Trends contain a comprehensive breakdown of messages by when they were sent, allowing you to observe messaging patterns over time. Daily trends display the number and percentage of messages sent during specific time periods: morning (4am to 10am), day (10am to 4pm), evening (4pm to 10pm), and night (10pm to 4am). Monthly trends, on the other hand, present the total number of messages sent for each month and year, allowing you to identify trends and patterns on a broader time scale.

This section showcases the top 10 days with the highest number of messages exchanged, giving you an overview of the most active and engaging periods. Additionally, it presents the 10 most used emojis, providing insight into the expressive elements that dominate your conversations.
